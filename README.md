# **GPT-3 OpenAI Landing Page**



This project is a React-based landing page inspired by the design of an OpenAI GPT-3 website. It was created to demonstrate my skills in modern front-end development, specifically using React and its ecosystem. The project showcases a clean, responsive, and engaging user interface.

## **Features üíª**

- Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

- Modern UI/UX: It features a dark-themed, sleek design with interactive elements and smooth transitions.

- Modular Components: The codebase is organized into reusable React components, making it scalable and easy to maintain.

- Static Content: The site serves as a static landing page, showcasing various sections like blog posts, features, and a call-to-action.



## **Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è**

- React: The core library for building the user interface.

- React Router Dom: For handling client-side routing, although this project is a single-page application, it's included for future expandability.

- HTML5 & CSS3: For the page structure and styling.

- JavaScript (ES6+): For the application logic.
